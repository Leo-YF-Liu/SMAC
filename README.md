# SMAC
The Spatial Multi-category Angle-based Classifier (SMAC) is a tool for the efficient identification of biomarkers in the imaging data. The proposed SMAC not only utilizes the spatial structure of high-dimensional imaging data, but also handles both binary and multi-category classification problems. Besides, the SMAC also include the functions to deal with imaging based regression problems, with spatial and sparse penalty available.
A GUI version is included under the folder GUI.
An example is included in SMAC_Classification_Example.m and SIM_REG.m.
Please refer to SMAC Manual_v1.0.pdf for a detailed instruction.
